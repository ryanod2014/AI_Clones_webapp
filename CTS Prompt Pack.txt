MINIMALIST & ABSTRACT PROMPTS:
Prompt 111:
Create a portrait of [the person] against a seamless, deep black background.
The background should feature a dramatic, introspective, and infinitely empty space:
– A pure, unending, non-reflective black void, achieved with black velvet or a large, unlit space.
– There are no textures, no details, and no horizon line in the background.
– The subject appears to be floating in this empty space.
– The focus is entirely on the form, expression, and lighting of the subject.
– All sense of place is removed, creating a purely psychological portrait.
Lighting should be sculptural and classic:
– A single, soft key light positioned to the side and slightly above the subject (classic Rembrandt lighting).
– This key light should illuminate one side of the face, creating a triangle of light on the shadowed cheek.
– No fill light is used, allowing the shadows to fall off into the pure black of the background, merging the subject with the void.
Style the setting as a pure, psychological space, with the only texture being that of the subject's skin, hair, and clothing.
Depth of field is irrelevant due to the seamless background, but the focus should be critically sharp on the subject's eyes.
Mood: dramatic, introspective, powerful, timeless.
Color palette: black, skin tones, and deep shadow.
Prompt 112:
Depict [the person] in a room with a single, harsh shadow.
The background should feature an artistic, mysterious, and high-concept graphic environment:
– A plain, seamless, off-white or light gray wall and floor (a cyclorama).
– The only feature in the background is the sharp, dark shadow being cast.
– The shadow is of a distinct, recognizable object that is out of frame, such as a large tropical plant, a window frame, or prison bars.
– The shadow falls across both the subject and the background, integrating them into a single graphic composition.
– The space is otherwise completely empty and devoid of detail.
Lighting should be singular and hard:
– A single, hard, undiffused light source (like a theatrical spot or a bare bulb) is used to create the sharp, well-defined shadow.
– This single source acts as the key light.
– No fill light is used, making the shadow area extremely dark and high-contrast.
Style the setting as a living graphic novel panel, with the only textures being the subject and the sharp, clean edge of the shadow.
Depth of field should be deep, keeping both the subject and the entire length of the sharp shadow in focus to preserve the graphic quality of the image.
Mood: artistic, mysterious, high-concept, stark.
Color palette: white, black, and one neutral tone.
Prompt 113:
Generate a portrait of [the person] behind a sheet of textured or frosted glass.
The background should feature an enigmatic, hidden, and dreamlike atmosphere:
– The subject is positioned behind a large pane of textured glass (e.g., reeded glass, pebbled glass, or heavily frosted glass).
– Their form and features are obscured and distorted by the texture of the glass.
– The background behind the subject is completely out of focus, becoming an abstract wash of indistinct shapes and colors.
– The focus of the image is on the texture of the glass itself, and the way it interacts with the light and the subject's form.
– Condensation or water droplets could be added to the glass for extra texture.
Lighting should be soft and diffused:
– A soft, strong backlight is placed behind the subject, causing them to appear as a silhouette or a semi-silhouette through the glass.
– A soft key light is placed in front of the glass, illuminating its texture and any water droplets.
– The light passing through the glass should create a soft, ethereal glow.
Style the setting as a dream or a memory, with textures of distorted glass, soft light, and the blurred, abstract colors of the background.
Depth of field should be extremely shallow, with the plane of focus being precisely on the surface of the textured glass.
Mood: enigmatic, hidden, dreamlike, obscured.
Color palette: muted, desaturated colors, soft whites.
Prompt 114:
Place [the person] in an all-white, empty room.
The background should feature a pure, clear, and futuristic "infinity cove":
– The walls, floor, and ceiling are all painted a pure, matte white and are curved together (a cyclorama) so there are no visible corners or edges.
– The space feels infinite, boundless, and completely clean.
– There are no objects, furniture, or details in the room whatsoever.
– The subject is the only element of color and form in the entire frame.
– The floor is slightly reflective, creating a soft, mirrored image of the subject.
Lighting should be high-key and shadowless:
– Multiple, large, diffused light sources are used from all angles—front, sides, and top.
– The goal is to overexpose the white background slightly, making it "blow out" to pure white, while keeping the subject perfectly exposed.
– This technique, known as high-key lighting, eliminates almost all shadows, creating a very clean, ethereal, and sometimes futuristic look.
Style the setting as a blank canvas or a virtual space, with the only texture being the subject themselves against the pure, featureless white.
Depth of field is deep, but the lack of background detail makes it feel infinite. The focus is entirely on the subject's form.
Mood: pure, clear, futuristic, isolated.
Color palette: pure white, with the subject as the only source of color.
Prompt 115:
Create a portrait using only colored light.
The background should feature a vibrant, modern, and experimental atmosphere:
– A simple, dark, non-reflective background, such as a matte gray or black wall.
– The background is kept dark so that it does not reflect the colored lights.
– The entire scene is constructed not with props or scenery, but with beams of pure, colored light.
– The subject is the canvas for the light.
– The air can have a slight haze or smoke to make the beams of colored light visible.
Lighting is the entire concept:
– No white light is used. Two or three lights with deep, saturated color gels are used.
– A classic setup is a key light with a magenta or deep blue gel from one side.
– A fill or rim light with a contrasting cyan or orange gel from the other side.
– The colors mix on the subject's skin and clothes, creating vibrant, electric lines and gradients.
Style the setting as a digital or otherworldly space, with the only texture being the way the pure, colored light wraps around the subject's form.
Depth of field should be shallow, keeping the subject's face in focus while the light wraps around them, with a sharp falloff into the black background.
Mood: vibrant, modern, experimental, electric.
Color palette: magenta, cyan, deep purple, black.
Prompt 116:
Depict [the person] with a projection on their face and body.
The background should feature an integrated, technological, and conceptual environment:
– A dark, plain, and non-reflective background to serve as a blank canvas.
– A digital projector, out of frame, is aimed at the subject.
– The projection consists of an abstract pattern, data, text, or a symbolic image (e.g., a star map, binary code, a circuit board pattern, floral designs).
– The projected image falls across the subject's face, body, and clothes, wrapping around their form.
– The subject is integrated into the projection, becoming part of the image.
Lighting is provided entirely by the projector:
– The projector itself acts as the key, fill, and backlight. The brightness and color of the projected image create the entire lighting scheme.
– The room is otherwise completely dark to ensure the projection is bright and vibrant.
– The light from the projector is hard and focused, creating sharp, clear images on the subject.
Style the setting as a fusion of human and data, with the only texture being the interplay between the projected pixels and the organic form of the subject.
Depth of field should be shallow, with the focus sharp on the subject's eyes, allowing the projected pattern to be clear on their face while softening on their body.
Mood: integrated, technological, conceptual, surreal.
Color palette: dependent on the projection, against a black background.
Prompt 117:
Generate a portrait of [the person] in a room of mirrors.
The background should feature a self-reflective, complex, and disorienting kaleidoscopic world:
– The walls, and perhaps the ceiling and floor, are covered in clean, flat mirrors.
– This creates an infinite number of reflections of the subject, stretching into a repeating, geometric pattern.
– The subject's reflection is seen from multiple angles simultaneously.
– The lines where the mirrors meet create a grid-like or fragmented pattern.
– The space feels both infinite and claustrophobic at the same time.
Lighting should be simple and carefully placed:
– A single, soft, diffused light source (like a lantern or a softbox) is placed in a position where the camera and the light itself are hidden from most reflections.
– This single source is multiplied by the mirrors, creating an infinite number of highlights and light sources in the reflections.
– The lighting should be soft to avoid harsh, distracting glare from the mirror surfaces.
Style the setting as an exploration of self and identity, with the only textures being the subject's form and the clean, sharp lines of the mirror edges.
Depth of field should be shallow, focusing on the "real" subject, while their infinite reflections recede into a soft, blurry, and mesmerizing pattern.
Mood: self-reflective, complex, disorienting, infinite.
Color palette: skin tones, black, and silver from the mirror edges.
Prompt 118:
Place [the person] in a minimalist space defined by a single, bold architectural line.
The background should feature a structured, bold, and design-focused environment:
– A minimalist, brutalist, or modern architectural space, likely made of cast concrete.
– The entire composition is dominated by a single, powerful architectural feature, such as a sharp, diagonal staircase, a dramatically curved wall, or a large, circular opening.
– The rest of the space is completely empty and devoid of detail.
– The human form of the subject is used to contrast with the hard, geometric lines of the architecture.
– The texture of the raw concrete or plaster is a key feature.
Lighting should be architectural and dramatic:
– A single, hard light source is used to emphasize the bold architectural line, casting a long, sharp shadow.
– The subject is placed at a key point along this line or in relation to the shadow.
– The light carves out the texture of the concrete, making it feel tangible and monumental.
Style the setting as a dialogue between human and architecture, with textures of raw, cast concrete, sharp shadows, and the soft form of the subject.
Depth of field should be deep, keeping both the subject and the powerful architectural line in sharp focus to emphasize the relationship between them.
Mood: structured, bold, design-focused, monumental.
Color palette: monochrome gray, white, black.
Prompt 119:
Create a portrait with extreme shallow depth of field.
The background is not a place, but an abstract element:
– The background is rendered completely abstract and out of focus, becoming a soft, painterly wash of color and light.
– The background could be a city street at night, a forest canopy, or a string of lights, but it is so blurred that it is unrecognizable.
– The only distinguishable features in the background are large, soft, circular orbs of light (bokeh).
– The entire focus of the image is on a very narrow slice of the subject, such as their eyes or lips.
– The subject's own hair, ears, and shoulders may also be soft and out of focus.
Lighting should be chosen to create beautiful bokeh:
– The lighting on the subject should be soft and flattering, perhaps from a large, diffused source.
– The background should contain many small, bright light sources, such as fairy lights, city lights, or sunlight filtering through leaves, which will become the bokeh.
– A wide aperture lens (like f/1.4) is essential to create this effect.
Style the setting as an intimate, dreamlike, and emotional portrait, with the only sharp texture being the subject's eyes, while everything else is soft and painterly.
Depth of field is the core concept: it is extremely shallow, creating a very intimate and focused portrait that isolates the subject from their environment.
Mood: intimate, focused, serene, dreamlike.
Color palette: soft, blended background colors with sharp, clear subject tones.
Prompt 120:
Depict [the person] as a silhouette against a brightly colored background.
The background should feature an anonymous, iconic, and graphic composition:
– A seamless paper backdrop or a cyclorama wall.
– The background is lit with colored gels to be a single, vibrant, and perfectly even field of color (e.g., electric orange, deep magenta, lime green).
– The subject is placed between the camera and this brightly lit background.
– Their form is reduced to a pure, black, and anonymous shape.
– The focus is on the clean, crisp outline of the subject's profile, hair, and body.
Lighting is entirely on the background:
– Two or more lights are aimed exclusively at the background, ensuring it is evenly and brightly lit.
– No light is allowed to spill onto the front of the subject. The subject is intentionally kept completely in shadow.
– This creates the high-contrast silhouette effect.
Style the setting as a bold, graphic design, with the only textures being the crisp edge of the silhouette against the perfectly smooth, vibrant color field.
Depth of field should be deep, ensuring that the edge of the silhouette is perfectly sharp and crisp against the background.
Mood: anonymous, iconic, graphic, bold.
Color palette: black and one single, vibrant color.
